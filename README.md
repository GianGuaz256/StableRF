# Stablecoin Risk Framework

## 1. Introduction

The Stablecoin Risk Framework provides a holistic approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating the multifaceted risks associated with stablecoins. Stablecoins, as digital assets pegged to fiat currencies or other assets, play a critical role in the digital economy but introduce unique risks due to their technological, financial, and operational characteristics. This framework ensures that stablecoin systems maintain stability, protect holders, and comply with regulatory standards.

### Purpose
- To offer a structured methodology for evaluating and managing risks in stablecoin ecosystems.
- To align with global regulatory standards and best practices for financial stability and consumer protection.
- To provide practical tools, including mathematical models and code, for real-world risk management.

### Scope
This framework applies to all types of stablecoins, including those backed by fiat, commodities, or algorithms, and considers both limited-purpose and global stablecoins.

## 2. Framework Structure

The framework is organized into five key categories, each with specific sub-factors that analysts evaluate. These categories cover the critical aspects of a stablecoin's risk profile:

### 2.1 Stability Assessment
- **Collateral and Reserves:** Quality and sufficiency of assets backing the stablecoin.
- **Peg Mechanism and Performance:** How well the stablecoin maintains its peg (e.g., to USD).

### 2.2 Management and Governance Evaluation
- **Team and Organization:** Experience, transparency, and reputation of the managing entity.
- **Governance Structure:** Decision-making processes and accountability.

### 2.3 Technical Implementation Review
- **Smart Contract Security:** Code audits and vulnerability history.
- **Oracle Systems:** Reliability of external data feeds (if applicable).
- **Upgradeability and Maintenance:** Flexibility and risks of protocol updates.

### 2.4 Decentralization and Resilience Analysis
- **Control and Censorship Resistance:** Degree of centralized control.
- **Network and Infrastructure Decentralization:** Distribution of nodes or validators.
- **Redundancy and Fail-safes:** Backup mechanisms for failure scenarios.

### 2.5 External and Systemic Risk Assessment
- **Regulatory and Legal Risks:** Compliance and jurisdictional exposure.
- **Market Sentiment and Adoption:** Public perception and usage levels.
- **Dependencies and Interconnectedness:** Reliance on other protocols or systems.
- **Stress Testing and Crisis Performance:** Behavior under extreme conditions.

## 3. Scoring System

Each sub-factor is scored by a human analyst on a 1-to-5 scale, based on data and expert judgment:

1. **High Risk (1):** Severe concerns (e.g., no collateral, unaudited code).
2. **Moderate Risk (2):** Notable issues but not critical (e.g., volatile collateral).
3. **Neutral (3):** Average performance, no major red flags.
4. **Low Risk (4):** Strong performance with minor concerns.
5. **Very Low Risk (5):** Best-in-class (e.g., fully audited, transparent reserves).

### Examples of Scoring

**Collateral and Reserves:**
- Backed by USD in a regulated bank = 5
- Backed by volatile crypto with low overcollateralization = 2

**Team and Organization:**
- Known team with regular updates = 5
- Anonymous team with no communication = 1

## 4. Weighting Mechanism

To account for differences in stablecoin types (e.g., fiat-backed, crypto-backed, algorithmic), each category is assigned a weight based on its relevance to the stablecoin's risk profile. The weights sum to 100% (1.0).

### Example Weightings

#### Fiat-Backed Stablecoins:
- Stability: 40%
- Management/Governance: 30%
- Technical: 10%
- Decentralization: 10%
- External: 10%

#### Crypto-Backed Stablecoins:
- Stability: 35%
- Technical: 30%
- Management/Governance: 15%
- Decentralization: 10%
- External: 10%

#### Algorithmic Stablecoins:
- Stability: 30%
- Governance: 25%
- Decentralization: 25%
- Technical: 10%
- External: 10%

*Note: Within each category, sub-factors are typically weighted equally unless specific risks justify adjustments (e.g., in Stability, Collateral and Peg Performance might each be 50%).*

## 5. Risk Categories

Stablecoin risks are categorized into eight key areas, each with sub-risks, definitions, and assessment methods. The foundation focuses on fundamental risks (Credit, Market, Liquidity, Operational), while it's also enhanced with advanced considerations (Technology, Governance, Regulatory, Systemic).

### 5.1 Credit Risk

## 6. Risk Assessment Methodology

Risk assessment combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a comprehensive view of each risk category.

### 6.1 Qualitative Assessment
- **Expert Judgment:** Leveraging insights from risk managers, technologists, and regulators.
- **Scenario Analysis:** Evaluating potential risk events (e.g., issuer insolvency, cyber-attacks).
- **Risk Mapping:** Visualizing risk interdependencies and concentrations.

### 6.2 Quantitative Assessment

Mathematical models and formulas are used to quantify risks. Below are key formulas and corresponding Python code for practical implementation.

#### 6.2.1 Credit Risk
**Probability of Default (PD):**
```
PD = Number of defaults / Total exposures
```

**Loss Given Default (LGD):**
```
LGD = 1 - Recovery Rate
```

**Exposure at Default (EAD):** Total exposure to the counterparty

**Expected Loss (EL):**
```
EL = PD × LGD × EAD
```

**Python Code:**
```python
def calculate_expected_loss(pd, lgd, ead):
    """
    Calculate Expected Loss (EL) for a credit exposure.
    
    Parameters:
    - pd: Probability of Default (float)
    - lgd: Loss Given Default (float)
    - ead: Exposure at Default (float)
    
    Returns:
    - EL: Expected Loss (float)
    """
    el = pd * lgd * ead
    return el

# Example usage
pd = 0.02  # 2% probability of default
lgd = 0.4  # 40% loss given default
ead = 1000000  # $1,000,000 exposure
el = calculate_expected_loss(pd, lgd, ead)
print(f"Expected Loss: ${el:.2f}")
```

#### 6.2.2 Market Risk
**Value-at-Risk (VaR):**
```
VaR = σ × Zα × √t
```

Where:
- σ: Standard deviation of returns
- Zα: Z-score for confidence level α
- t: Time horizon in days

**Python Code:**
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

def calculate_var(returns, confidence_level=0.95, time_horizon=1):
    """
    Calculate Value-at-Risk (VaR) for a given set of returns.
    
    Parameters:
    - returns: Array of historical returns (list or np.array)
    - confidence_level: Desired confidence level (float, default: 0.95)
    - time_horizon: Time horizon in days (int, default: 1)

    z_score = norm.ppf(1 - confidence_level)
    var = mean + z_score * std_dev * np.sqrt(time_horizon)
    return var

# Example usage
returns = np.random.normal(0, 0.01, 1000)  # Simulated returns

print(f"VaR at 95% confidence level: {var:.4f}")
```

#### 6.2.3 Liquidity Risk
**Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):**
```
LCR = High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) / Total Net Cash Outflows over 30 days
```

    """
    lcr = hqla / net_cash_outflows if net_cash_outflows != 0 else float('inf')
    return lcr

# Example usage
hqla = 500000  # $500,000 in HQLA

print(f"Liquidity Coverage Ratio: {lcr:.2f}")
```

#### 6.2.4 Operational Risk
**Operational VaR:** Similar to market VaR but based on historical operational loss data.

**Formula:**
```
OpVaR = μ + σ × Zα
```

Where μ is the mean loss, and σ is the standard deviation of losses.

    """
    # Simplified CVSS calculation (actual formula is more complex)
    cvss = base_score * temporal_score * environmental_score
    return min(cvss, 10.0)

# Example usage
base = 8.0
temporal = 0.9
environmental = 1.0
cvss_score = calculate_cvss(base, temporal, environmental)
print(f"CVSS Score: {cvss_score:.1f}")
```

#### 6.2.6 Governance Risk
**Governance Score:** A composite score based on transparency, accountability, and compliance.

**Formula:** Weighted average of sub-scores.

    return score

# Example usage
transparency = 80
accountability = 70
compliance = 90
governance_score = calculate_governance_score(transparency, accountability, compliance)
print(f"Governance Score: {governance_score:.2f}")

#### 6.2.7 Regulatory Risk
**Compliance Score:** Percentage of regulatory requirements met.

**Formula:**
```
Compliance Score = (Number of compliant areas / Total regulatory requirements) × 100
```

**Python Code:**
```python
def calculate_compliance_score(compliant_areas, total_requirements):
    """
